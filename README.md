# combination-watchface
Pebble watchface designed to look like the cylinders on a combination lock.

Pull requests are welcome, as this is the first code I've written in C since university, so it's likely to need some refactoring.

Todo List:

- ~~Animated transition on clock ticks~~
- Configurable text colour and size
- Configurable background colour
- Fix 24 byte memory leak that happens on app close
- Add option to display date & battery level
